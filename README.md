# Excel Project
This Excel project provides an annual sales report for a store, using pivot tables to analyze sales trends, customer demographics
(gender and age), top sales channels, and product categories. It identifies the highest sales month, examines order status, and lists the
top 10 contributing states for actionable insights.
